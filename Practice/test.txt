SW1 is the root bridge.
SW1: 
G0/0 : DS G0/1 : DS
SW2:
G0/0 : Root port 
G0/1: DS
SW3:
G0/2: Root port G0/0: DS G0/1: Backup
SW4: 
G0/1: Root port G0/0: Alternate
  so why
19:53
did SW4 choose G0/1 over G0/0? It’s because the neighbor bridge ID is lower via G0/1, because SW2 has a lower MAC address
20:03
than SW3

How about SW3’s G0/1 and SW4’s G0/0? SW3’s G0/1 receives the superior BPDU, with the lower port ID, from the same switch, so
20:43
it's a backup port. SW4’s G0/0 receives the superior BPDU from a different switch, so it is an alternate
20:52
port.

For example, in this network traffic from PC1 to PC2 usually follows this path.
26:04
But what if this connection is cut off? This switch will think: I can’t reach this neighbor anymore.
26:10
I’ll clear all entries for this interface from my MAC table, and its other interface will
26:15
become the root port. Then, if PC1 wants to send traffic to PC2 again, it will go through the normal process
26:23
of flooding until it learns the MAC address on this new interface, and traffic will now follow this path.
26:29
That’s just a quick look at how topology changes are handled in rapid STP.

The listening state was deemed unnecessary, and in fact the learning state is often skipped
32:19
due to the built-in features of rapid STP, like UplinkFast and BackboneFast.





RSTP Quiz 4

SW1 is the root bridge,
G0/0: DS G0/1: DS G0/2: DS G0/3: DS

SW2:
g0/0: Root port G0/1: DS G0/2: Backup G0/3: DS
(Why was an interface on SW2 and not SW4 selected to be designated?
Because SW2 has the lower root cost.)
SW3:
G0/0: DS G0/1: Alternate G0/2: Root port (cause neighbor port ID G0/1 is lower) G0/3: DS

SW4:
G0/0; Root port  G0/1: Alternate G0/2: DS


Frames are sent to the neighboring switch to see if it wants to form an EtherChannel, and then the switches agree upon either forming an EtherChannel or not.
