SW1 is the root bridge.SW1: G0/0 : DS G0/1 : DSSW2:G0/0 : Root port G0/1: DSSW3:G0/2: Root port G0/0: DS G0/1: BackupSW4: G0/1: Root port G0/0: Alternate  so whydid SW4 choose G0/1 over G0/0? It’s because the neighbor bridge ID is lower via G0/1, because SW2 has a lower MAC addressthan SW3How about SW3’s G0/1 and SW4’s G0/0? SW3’s G0/1 receives the superior BPDU, with the lower port ID, from the same switch, soit's a backup port. SW4’s G0/0 receives the superior BPDU from a different switch, so it is an alternateport.For example, in this network traffic from PC1 to PC2 usually follows this path.But what if this connection is cut off? This switch will think: I can’t reach this neighbor anymore.I’ll clear all entries for this interface from my MAC table, and its other interface willbecome the root port. Then, if PC1 wants to send traffic to PC2 again, it will go through the normal processof flooding until it learns the MAC address on this new interface, and traffic will now follow this path.That’s just a quick look at how topology changes are handled in rapid STP.The listening state was deemed unnecessary, and in fact the learning state is often skippeddue to the built-in features of rapid STP, like UplinkFast and BackboneFast.RSTP Quiz 4SW1 is the root bridge,G0/0: DS G0/1: DS G0/2: DS G0/3: DSSW2:g0/0: Root port G0/1: DS G0/2: Backup G0/3: DS(Why was an interface on SW2 and not SW4 selected to be designated?Because SW2 has the lower root cost.)SW3:G0/0: DS G0/1: Alternate G0/2: Root port (cause neighbor port ID G0/1 is lower) G0/3: DSSW4:G0/0; Root port  G0/1: Alternate G0/2: DSFrames are sent to the neighboring switch to see if it wants to form an EtherChannel, and then the switches agree upon either forming an EtherChannel or not.
